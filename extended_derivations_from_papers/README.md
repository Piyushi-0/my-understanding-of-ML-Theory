A collection of mostly elegant & some not-so-elegant-but-handy proofs from papers along with a detailed (extended) derivations.
1. LFR_IPM.pdf : Covers Lemma1's proof which is not detailed in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02943.pdf).
2. [Optimization-related](./Optimization-related.md)

     -  From [Minimizing Finite Sums with the Stochastic Average Gradient](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.2388.pdf).
     - From [Large Stepsize Gradient Descent for Logistic Loss: Non-Monotonicity of the Loss Improves Optimization Efficiency](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v247/wu24b.html).
