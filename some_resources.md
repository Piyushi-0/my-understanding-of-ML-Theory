The following resources are curated by the author & these could be helpful to ML theory beginners. <br><br>
(Whatever little knowledge I have of ML theory, I gained it from the courses & discussion sessions of [Prof. J. Saketha Nath](https://www.iith.ac.in/~saketha/) and from reading standard ML books. Hence, I strongly recommend doing coursework & reading std books as the best way to get started in this field.)
